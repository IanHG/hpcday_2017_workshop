/*
This is the main readme file.

Hi, this is a small workshop on compiling and submitting jobs using
the new Grendel-S software stack :) Enjoy...

To get vim to use syntax highlighting for readme files (like this one) type (inside vim):
   : syntax on
   : source tutorial.vim

Every line prepended with '$' means it a console command,
so you should probably type it in to the console. Like this:

   $ ls 

All examples are meant to be typed in :)

The examples are the following:
   
   0_basic
   1_compile
   2_openmpi
   3_slurm
   4_gpm

They are in principle meant to be followed in order,
but you rae free to do them in any order you want.

                        "Good luck, have fun!"
