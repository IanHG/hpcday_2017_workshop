/* 
In this exercise we learn how to submit a job to the slurm queue system.

We will see how the 'srun' command will handle resources for mpi jobs.
*/

1) *** Take a look at the submit script ***
   
   It is located in the file 'submit.sh'. 
   Open it using your favorite terminal editor.

2) *** Compile the small program ***

   Compile the small test program.
   
      $ ml gcc/7.1.0
      $ ml openmpi/2.1.1
      $ mpicc -o hello_world.x main.c

   You can also try a different setup if you so desire.

3) *** Submitting jobs ***

   You submit a jobscript by calling 'sbatch' with the script as an argument:
      
      $ sbatch submit.sh

   Try to do that now. After the job has run, you will see a file called
   'slurm-<jobid>.out'. This file collects all output written to stdout or stderr
   from the slurm job. Open the file an notice that our two MPI ranks where run on
   the same node. Try changing the number of nodes by changing the line:  
   
      '#SBATCH --nodes 1' ->  '#SBATCH --nodes 2'

   Resubmit your slurm script. Open the new slurm output file. Here you can see
   that the job has now run on two different nodes. Also notice that we didn't change
   any arguments to 'srun', we only changed the number of nodes at the top of our script
   and 'srun' automatically adjusted.

4) *** Other useful SLURM script settings ***

   Useful headers:

      # Send email 
      #SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL           # Send and email when job ends or if it fails.
      #SBATCH --mail-user=<your-email-here>  # Insert your email here.

      # Write stdout/stderr output, %j is replaced with the job number
      #SBATCH --output slurm-%j.txt     # write stdout to a given file.
      #SBATCH --error  slurm-%j.txt     # write stderr to a given file.
