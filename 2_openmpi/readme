/*
In this exercise you learn how to compile an mpi program,
and how to run on the front-end (which you shouldn't do, so shame on you!)
*/

0) *** Remember ... ***
   
   ... to source the module system (if you forgot how, go back and look).
   
1) *** Load and compile with gcc and openmpi ***
   
   Load gcc and openmpi:

      $ ml gcc
      $ ml openmpi/2.1.0

   Compile with mpi-compiler:

      $ mpicc -o hello_world_mpi_gcc.x main.c
   
   Run program:

      $ mpirun -n 2 ./hello_world_mpi_gcc.x

   Here '-n 2' sets the number of processes. 
   You can try cranking it up, but don't go to high. 
   Keep below 20 today :).

2) *** Fast swap to intel ***

   Fast swap to intel compiler.

      $ ml intel

   Oh shi*! Inactive module ?? Run:

      $ ml av
   
   Notice there is no openmpi loaded yet for the intel compiler.
   Openmpi gets in-activated as there is no openmpi/2.1.0 for the intel compiler to swap to,
   and lmod cannot accces the one loaded for gcc, and inactivates it. 
   Load the intel openmpi/2.1.1 manually by typing:

      $ ml openmpi/2.1.1

   Then compile and run the program:

      $ mpicc -o hello_world_mpi_intel.x main.c
      $ mpirun -n 2 ./hello_world_mpi_intel.x
